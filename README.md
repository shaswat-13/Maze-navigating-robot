This repository consists the code for a maze navigating robot named "penelope"
It has been coded in arduino ide as a final project to the fellowship we attended on hardwares and microcontrollers.
Our team (pratik, raman, sitish and me) constructed a maze navigating robot using 3 IR sensors, a L293D motor driver and an arduino uno
which also managed to get second position in the competition with a time of 34 seconds.
